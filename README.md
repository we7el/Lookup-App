# Lookup App

This repository implements a web app where you can **upload** and **semantically** search across many of your documents.

This project has been implemented from scratch using the Flask micro web framework. It uses Google's Universal Sentence Encoder and an unsupervised algorithm to retrieve the closest segments of the documents you want to search across.

Think of it as a search engine, but for your documents!

## Installation and Usage

Just clone this repository and install the requirements

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Flask app
```bash
python app.py
```
You can either go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) or deploy it on a server.
